    <h1>People's Kitchen De Sering</h1>

    <p>
      Every Monday we serve two vegan courses for a suggested donation of €2.50-€5.00. Everyone is welcome
      between 18:30 and 22:00 at NieuwLand (Pieter Nieuwlandstraat 93). To ensure that we have enough space to have a
      corona safe meetup we ask you to make a reservation using the form linked below.

    <p>
      De Sering is moving to a new location, along with our pop-up restaurant TestTafel. This spring our people's
      kitchen will re-open at De Sloot: the largest theatre breeding space in The Netherlands. We will have enough space
      to do everything we ever dreamed of: a massive 300m<sup>2</sup> hall and 200m<sup>2</sup> terrace.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to make this happen we need your help! We are starting a crowdfund through the platform CrowdAboutNow  to
      for our starting budget. This can be done through small loans or by buying credits in our presale that you can spend 
      at our new location once we open. You can find more details on the crowdfund page through the button
      below.
