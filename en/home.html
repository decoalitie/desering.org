		<h1>People's Kitchen De Sering</h1>

		<p>
		Every Tuesday we serve two vegan courses for a suggested donation of €2.50-€5.00. Everyone is welcome between 18:30 and 21:30 at NieuwLand (Pieter Nieuwlandstraat 93). To ensure that we have enough space to have a corona safe meetup we ask you to make a reservation using the form linked below.
