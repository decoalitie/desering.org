      <h3>We have moved!</h3>

      <p>
        As some of you may already know, we are moving De Sering to our own location. You can read more about it further
        down
        this page. We are still busy finalizing the space and our kitchen. In May we will have an official opening
        party.
        We will update you about that soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, despite not everything being 100% finished, the space is ready for us to host our People's Kitchen!
      </p>

      <p>
        From now on, we will open <strong>on Tuesdays</strong>. <br \>
        The new address is: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FH6mnMV8KK8rYiir8" target="_blank"><strong>Rhôneweg
            6</strong>, 1043AH Amsterdam</a>

    <h1>People's Kitchen De Sering</h1>

    <p>
      Every Tuesday we serve two vegan courses for a suggested donation of €2.50-€5.00. Everyone is welcome
      between 18:30 and 22:00 at Rhôneweg 6.
    </p>


    <p>It's no longer necessary to make a reservation. Please feel free to drop by!</p>

    <p>
      De Sering is moving to a new location, along with our pop-up restaurant TestTafel. We will have our own space at
      De Sloot: the largest theatre breeding space in The Netherlands. We will have enough space
      to do everything we ever dreamed of: a massive 300m<sup>2</sup> hall and 200m<sup>2</sup> terrace.
    </p>

    <p>
      We started a crowdfund through the platform CrowdAboutNow for our starting budget. This can be done through
      small loans or by buying credits in our presale that you can spend at our new location once we open.
    </p>

    <p>
      This crowdfund has reached 100% of our minimum funding goal! This gives us enough money for everything that's
      strictly necessary for us to open. It makes it possible for us to host The People's Kitchen from this new location
      from April 12th onwards. Many thanks to everyone who helped us reaching this goal!
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we are not done yet: to completely finish up the space as we envisioned, we need the crowdfund to
      gather another €60.000. This allows us to open in a way that truly utilizes this awesome space.
    </p>
