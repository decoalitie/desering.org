  <h2>Become a volunteer!</h2>

  <p>
    The People's Kitchen is operated entirely by volunteers.
    Every Sunday we all cook together to prepare food for upcoming days.
    For example for the People's Kitchen evenings, refugee organisations, and protests.
    If you want to help out you can simply come by on a Sunday from 12:30.
    You can then also join for free for lunch (12:00-12:30) and dinner (18:00-18:30).
    Would you like to know more? Send an email to <a href="mailto:info@desering.org">info@desering.org</a>

  <h2>Come work with us!</h2>

  <p>
    At De Sering we organise <a href="https://testtafel.nl/">TestTafel</a>, host parties and lectures,
    welcome pop-ups and have a huge terrace. To keep it all going, we have a staff of part-timers
    and full-timers.
  </p>

  <p>
    You don't need any experience to start working with us.
    Because of the way we are organised, you can have a say right from the start,
    for example about the TestTafel menu or the wines. Your initiatives and ideas are also very
    much appreciated and welcomed. If you have ideas for cocktails or events for example,
    then there is the freedom to try them out.
  </p>

  <p>

    Because De Sering is a non-profit with the aim to offer public space as cheap as possible,
    everyone currently gets minimum wage.
    In time, we want to build up the salary to an equal 14 euros per hour for everyone.
