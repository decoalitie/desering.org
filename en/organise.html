<h2>Use our space!</h2>

<p>
  De Sering's goal is to create public space. 
  This means that you can use the space for activities and events with a public function. 
  Whether you want to organise a dance night, a meeting with your book club, or you want to 
  run your own pop-up restaurant from our kitchen for an evening: the possibilities are endless! 
  We strive to keep this as cheap as possible (and in many cases even completely free!)
</p>

<p>
  Do you have an idea for an activity? We'd love to talk to you! You can reach us at info@desering.org. <a href="mailto:info@desering.org">info@desering.org</a>.
</p>

<h2>Rental</h2>

<p>
  You can also rent our space for other types of events. Think for example of a private wedding party, a private dinner or a corporate event.
</p>

<p>
  The costs are determined in consultation and depend on what your event needs. We work with a turnover guarantee or a fixed rental price depending on the type of event.
</p>
