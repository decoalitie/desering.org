<p>
  For the starting budget of our <a href="{% link en/testtafel/news/testtafel-has-a-new-home.html %}">new location</a>
  we started a crowdfund campaign through the platform CrowdAboutNow. This is where you can support us with a small
  loan or by buying credit in our presale.

  By now we have reached 100% of our minimum goal! That means we have all the money we need for things that are
  essential to opening De Sering. Thank you for your support!</p>

<p>
  We aren't done yet though! To fully realize all our plans for De Sering and TestTafel, we need another
  â‚¬60.000. That money will allow us to open in a way that makes good use of this large space. Think for example
  of a walk-in cooler, a coffee machine or an outside bar. So if you aren't part of our crowdfund yet,
  please help us reach that 200% to prepare De Sering for a great summer!</p>
