  After hosting TestTafel for over half a year from "a secret location in Amsterdam", we finally found our
  own place! It's a location that we couldn't have dreamed of: with a giant 300m<sup>2</sup> hall of and
  a 200m<sup>2</sup> terrace we can bring our restaurant to the next level.
  Our space is located within walking distance of Amsterdam Sloterdijk train station, on the largest theater 
  incubator grounds in The Netherlands: <strong>De Sloot</strong>. Here the theatre groups <em>toneelgroep Amsterdam</em>,
  <em>BOG.</em>, and others are building theater workspaces, stages and a lot more.
  We are very grateful to be a part of this wonderful project.
</p>

<p>
  Our new address: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xYtWUy2bsutxXdDr9" target="_blank">Rhoneweg 6, 1043AH, Amsterdam</a>
</p>

<p>
  Our new location will have the name of the project that is moving with us: <strong>De Sering</strong>. 
  The available space will not be sitting empty when there is no TestTafel: the People's Kitchen from De
  Sering will also serve food here. De Sering will also offer the space for free to initiatives with social
  or cultural importance.
</p>

<p>
  As you've come to expect from us, we at TestTafel will continue to experiment with new menus at an accessible price.
  We have formalized our goal to finance De Sering: TestTafel is now registered as a foundation, with the statutory 
  goal to financially support De Sering.
