<p>
  We can't wait for you to join us for TestTafel again! And although we're still in the process of renovating,
  everything we need to serve you the TestTafel menus you've come to expect from us is in place. That's why, prior to
  our official opening party at the end of May, you can already get a taste of our new kitchen.
</p>

<p>You can now make a reservation for the following dates:</p>

<ul class="date-list">
  <li>Friday April 22nd</li>
  <li>Saturday April 23rd</li>
  <li>Sunday April 24th</li>
  <li>Friday April 29th</li>
  <li>Saturday April 30th</li>
  <li>Sunday May 1st</li>
</ul>

<a class="button" href="{% link en/testtafel/reservation.html %}">Open the reservation form</a>

<p>
  At these kickstart dinners you can expect, as usual, a seven-course menu for a suggested donation of â‚¬25. In addition
  we also hope these dinners will help us raise money to complete renovations of De Sering. Therefore, we ask people
  who can spare the money to donate extra for their food on these evenings. There will also be the possibility to sign
  up for our crowdfunding campaign with a small loan or through buying credit in our pre-sale.
