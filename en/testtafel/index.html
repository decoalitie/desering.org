    <h1>TestTafel</h1>

    <p>
      TestTafel is a restaurant that pops up every Saturday and Sunday to serve a 7 course meal (including amuses,
      bread, and coffee bites) for just €20. Our menu is an eclectic collection of recipes we have been wanting to make
      for years, dishes stolen from our favourite chefs, and recipes found in obscure cookbooks.
    </p>

    <p>
      With dinner we serve cocktails, homemade lemonades, and our favourite cheapy wines. All of this takes place at a
      secret location in the centre of Amsterdam (the location will be revealed when we confirm your reservation).

    <h3>Prices</h3>

    <p>
      For our food we kindly ask you to make a donation. The suggested donation is between €20 and €30 per person.
      We will always serve you a full menu, and we can take most diets and allergies into account. For example, we
      also serve fully vegan or vegetarian menus.
    </p>

    <p>
      We encourage everyone to donate the amount that they feel comfortable with, based on whatever reasons they may
      have. Please don't worry about donating too little. Even with just €20 donations we can continue operating
      TestTafel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, you can order drinks at a fixed price. We try to keep the drinks about two or three times as cheap
      compared to a normal restaurant.

    <h3>Updated COVID-19 policy</h3>

    <p>
      Due to recent coronavirus developments and the limited amount of space we have, our COVID policy is more
      strict than usual. Currently we ask all our guests to show both:
    </p>

    <ol class="requirements-list">
      <li>An official <a href="https://coronacheck.nl/en/">CoronaCheck</a> QR code with a proof of identity (such
        as an ID card)
        <br /><strong>and</strong>
      </li>
      <li>a physical negative self-test result</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      You can do the self-test at home shortly before you leave for TestTafel. Please bring the <strong>physical
        result</strong> (the test itself, not a picture of the test!) to TestTafel. If you don't have a self-test
      you can get one from us at the door and test yourself at the venue.
