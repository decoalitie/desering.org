    <h1>TestTafel</h1>

    <p>
      TestTafel is a restaurant that pops up every Friday and Saturday to serve a 7 course meal (including amuses,
      bread, and coffee bites) for just €20. Our menu is an eclectic collection of recipes we have been wanting to make
      for years, dishes stolen from our favourite chefs, and recipes found in obscure cookbooks.
    </p>

    <p>
      With dinner we serve cocktails, homemade lemonades, and our favourite cheapy wines. All of this takes place at a
      secret location in the centre of Amsterdam (the location will be revealed when we confirm your reservation).

    <h3>Prices</h3>

    <p>
      For our food we kindly ask you to make a donation. The suggested donation is between €20 and €30 per person.
      We will always serve you a full menu, and we can take most diets and allergies into account. For example, we
      also serve fully vegan or vegetarian menus.
    </p>

    <p>
      We encourage everyone to donate the amount that they feel comfortable with, based on whatever reasons they may
      have. Please don't worry about donating too little. Even with just €20 donations we can continue operating
      TestTafel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, you can order drinks at a fixed price. We try to keep the drinks about two or three times as cheap
      compared to a normal restaurant.

    <h3>Covid policy</h3>

    <p>
      For safety reasons, we ask all our guests to provide a proof of covid vaccination or test. You can do this in 2
      ways:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        You can provide an official proof of testing or vaccination through the <a href="https://coronacheck.nl/en"
          target="_blank">CoronaCheck app</a>. This app will provide you with a QR code that you can scan at the door.
        We kindly request you to bring the QR code of this specific app from the Dutch government, because we cannot
        guarantee that we can verify other international codes or documents. If we are unable to scan your code, we may
        ask you to do a self-test instead (see below).
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternatively, you can bring a self-test or buy one at the door. You can indicate this on the reservation form.
        You can do the self-test on arrival at TestTafel, or do the test shortly before. If you choose to test at home,
        please bring the <strong>physical result</strong> (the stick with the check-line) rather than a photo of a test.
      </li>
    </ol>
