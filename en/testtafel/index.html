    <p>
      TestTafel is a restaurant that pops up every Saturday and Sunday to serve a 7 course meal (including amuses,
      bread, and coffee bites) for just €20. Our menu is an eclectic collection of recipes we have been wanting to make
      for years, dishes stolen from our favourite chefs, and recipes found in obscure cookbooks.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      With dinner we serve cocktails, homemade lemonades, and our favourite cheapy wines. All of this takes place at a
      secret location in the centre of Amsterdam (the location will be revealed when we confirm your reservation).

    <p>
      This spring we will re-open TestTafel at a new location: De Sloot. With a giant 300m<sup>2</sup> hall and a
      200m<sup>2</sup> terrace we can bring our restaurant to the next level. There will also be enough space for our <a
        href="{% link en/home.html %}">People's Kitchen De Sering</a> and all their activities. While we are working
      hard
      to prepare this space to welcome our new guests, our restaurant is unfortunately closed.
    </p>

    <h3>We need your support!</h3>

    <p>
      We started a crowdfund campaign for our starting budget through the platform CrowdAboutNow. You can contribute
      through small loans or by buying credit that you can spend in our restaurant once we are open. More information
      can be found on <a href="https://crowdaboutnow.nl/testtafel" target="_blank">our crowdfund page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>If you have friends or family that might be interested and able to help us out, sharing our <a

    <h3>Prices</h3>

    <p>
      For our food we kindly ask you to make a donation. The suggested donation is between €20 and €30 per person.
      We will always serve you a full menu, and we can take most diets and allergies into account. For example, we
      also serve fully vegan or vegetarian menus.
    </p>

    <p>
      We encourage everyone to donate the amount that they feel comfortable with, based on whatever reasons they may
      have. Please don't worry about donating too little. Even with just €20 donations we can continue operating
      TestTafel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, you can order drinks at a fixed price. We try to keep the drinks about two or three times as cheap
      compared to a normal restaurant.

    <h3>Updated COVID-19 policy</h3>

    <p>
      Due to recent coronavirus developments and the limited amount of space we have, our COVID policy is more
      strict than usual. Currently we ask all our guests to show both:
    </p>

    <ol class="requirements-list">
      <li>An official <a href="https://coronacheck.nl/en/">CoronaCheck</a> QR code with a proof of identity (such
        as an ID card)
        <br /><strong>and</strong>
      </li>
      <li>a physical negative self-test result</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      You can do the self-test at home shortly before you leave for TestTafel. Please bring the <strong>physical
        result</strong> (the test itself, not a picture of the test!) to TestTafel. If you don't have a self-test
      you can get one from us at the door and test yourself at the venue.
