<h2>Casting theater dinner</h2>

<p>
  For Toneelgroep Amsterdam's play <em>Casting</em> we serve a three-course menu (plus bread) for between 25 and 35 euros.

<p>
  The theater dinner always starts at 19:30. On Wednesday and Thursday you are welcome from 17:00 for a drink, and on Friday and Saturday the terrace will be open from 13:00.
