  Thank you to everyone who came out to our opening event. We were overwhelmed with all the kind people, the great dance moves and all the kind words about our space.

  The opening of De Sering, along with the opening party, wouldn't have been possible without the help of many volunteers. Thank you to all the people who took some time out of their busy schedules to help us out, and a double thank you to those who volunteered many days for construction work.
