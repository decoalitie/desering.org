  <p>Reduce, Reuse, Refuse!</p>

  <p>Rewear, Repair, Rebel!</p>

  <p>
    At Guerilla Repair the rebels from XR Fashion Action will repair clothing and teach people that want to learn how to do it themselves.
    They will meditate on the clothes, hand out clothing patches and help you breathe new life into your clothes! 
  </p>

  <p>
    Bring with you: an item of clothing to repair
